## My process

Analyzing and understanding the design, breaking it down and making a plan.
Installing and connecting whichever frameworks or packages I will be using
HTML, CSS then JS for functionality
When it comes to styling I like to start with properties not affected with resizing and any necessary research.
After everythings done I do my README documentation
Lastly the deployment process, github, netlify, any fixing, then mentor from there on I fix any remainging errors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Overall I've gaine a better understanding of semantics, react, and styling that should come with ease.
I do think most of my sizing dilemmas are rooted in perfectionism.

```html
I made an attempt of decreasing my usage of divs for every other tag and when
down the semantic html road this time.
```

```sass
  Background image sizing and how to make it resize from mobile to desktop
  Overall better understanding of sass and its hierarchy, and the implementation of variables.
```

```js
   I attempted to use typescript when using javascript of jsx however it didn't go as planned which
   resulted in me going a different route.

```

### Continued development

On the next project I hope to actually understand how to implement typescript, I also think introducing some more react jsx would be beneficial. Not because its necessary, but practicing would do me good.
Also reducing my time spent per project atleast by an hour. This one took me nearly 4hours.
